# antiprotonflux-neural-networks

This repository contains the code used my bachelor's thesis "Neural networks for event generation in astroparticle physics". A Python environment with the common used data science libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas) is needed to run this code.

The data used is taken from the website http://www.marcocirelli.net/PPPC4DMID.html.
